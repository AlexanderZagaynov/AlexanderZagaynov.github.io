I was born at the beginning of the frozen winter of 1980, year of the Moscow Olympic Games, in one of the former USSR out-of-the-way little known provinces.

*Singing marches with a bears and 'balalaikas'* was a boring entertainment, but another fun's were impenetrable. *Oh, magnificent IKEA's ballrom! Why I'm not in my five years age now?*

That's why I'm hurry up to learn alphabet, and fall in love with westerly science fiction (it's just become passed by censorship with the 'perestroyka' rise).

Sci-Fi teached me to do the most important thing in my life - to dream about the perfect future, sharpened with the science. To believe, that science can change the world, and make it a better place, much more wider and amicable.

And when people asked me a question 'who do you want to be?', I always says: 'of course, I want to be a spaceman!' But life is not so straightforward.

When the Soviet Union start to break down, my beloved parents, piled up roubles for many years to buy a car of a dream *'Moskvitch'*, decide to hurry up, and spend all savings, until they become a disposable paper.

The most expensive and strange thing in the shop was a... computer! [Elektronika BK-0011M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronika_BK), my first obsession! Of course, it was immediately ocupied by me :)

Quickly I was bored of just a games playing *(may be, it is because, they were primitive and monochromatic?)*. And I start to seek a way to *improve* them. Make a hero invulnerable for enemies, as example.

That's that, I learned [PDP-11 assembler language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11_architecture), and turned to be a programmer.

In my seventeen, when my *sane* coevals learned how to make love each other, I discovered a wonderful world of dial-up internet, and learn to make web-sites.

Unfortunately, 1998's economic breakdown impel me to move to Moscow and switch to ERP development and implementation direction, with [1C:&nbsp;Enterprise](http://1c-dn.com/1c_enterprise/what_is_1c_enterprise/) and Microsoft corporate software speciality.

It must be admitted, that this fifteen career years were not so bad. And I even grew up to a big CIO boss in one of corporate giants. But this arid stuff can be read up in my [linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zalex80)

Several years ago my meaning of life was losed in the professional burnout. And I leave my IT management career, and become a viator in searching of new horizons.

I travelled a lot around the world, meet new interesting persons, soak up the cultures I get to know, and had a much thinking about what to do next.

Now I return back with a new targets. I want to do smart, complex, creative and beatiful things, for a broad groups of people. And, in my humble opinion, the best tool for this - is a web technologies.

In my work I use Ruby on Rails, and a tied-up techs - html, css & javascript (slim, sass & coffeescript).

Here I write about my experiense gain, curious tasks I met, and the ways I complete them.
