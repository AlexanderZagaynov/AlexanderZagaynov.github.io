I was born at the beginning of frozen winter of 1980,
year of the [Moscow Olympic Games,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_Summer_Olympics)
in the [one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mari_El) of the former USSR out-of-the-way little known provinces.

Before computers, being kid, I was insatiable science fiction books reader.
Nowadays I love to watch popscience channels, and [rationality](https://www.lesswrong.com).
My favourite books are "[The Selfish Gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene)",
"[The Origins of Virtue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origins_of_Virtue)",
and "[Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](https://www.hpmor.com)"

I learned programming with the [Electronica MK-54](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MK-54.JPG) calculator,
and the [Elektronika BK-0011M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronika_BK) computer,
Soviet clone of the [DEC PDP-11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11).

I liked drawing and animating bouncing circles with the built-in [BASIC language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC).
Games it had were quite slow and boring, and I was lazy enough to learn how to hack them to ease walking through,
by using an [assembler language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11_architecture) debugger.

In the 1995 I met an [IBM PC XT 286](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer_XT#IBM_XT_286),
learned [DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS) and [Turbo Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal) at school.
Next year I got a [Pentium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium) computer,
learned to use [Adobe PageMaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_PageMaker),
make 3d animations in [Autodesk 3D Studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk_3ds_Max),
and hacked few games with [NuMega SoftICE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoftICE).

At my first job I implemented the salary taxes datebase system for a local company using [FoxPro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FoxPro).
On a second - optimized shipment documents generation process, which saved a lot of human workhours.

Then came dial-up internet, I left everything for a garage startup with my schoolmate, where I made a couple of web-sites,
using [Macromedia Dreamweaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Dreamweaver),
[Adobe Photoshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop) and [ImageReady](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_ImageReady),
tried to play with [Macromedia Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash).

1998's economic breakdown impel me to move to Moscow and switch to ERP development and implementation direction,
with [1C:Enterprise Platform](https://1c-dn.com) and Microsoft corporate software speciality.
It must be admitted, this fifteen career years were not so bad. And I even grew up to CIO in a mid-sized company,
where got the burnout and left IT management career to become a viator looking for the new horizons.

I travelled a lot around the world, meeting new people, and soaking up the different cultures. Staying in Cambodia,
I learned [Objective-C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C) language, thinking to become an iOS developer,
but withal met the [Ruby language](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en) and fell in love with its magic.

After year of junior practice in a couple of local companies and a year of freelance on Upwork,
I went to [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en) and moved to the [Brno city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brno)
of the [Czech Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic).
Here I learned Linux, and earned a few [certifications](https://rhtapps.redhat.com/verify/?certId=170-221-550).

Currently I work as a [Lead Software Engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zalex80/?locale=en_US)
at [EPAM](https://www.epam.com) company, supporting and developing dozens of Ruby on Rails based banking microservices.
